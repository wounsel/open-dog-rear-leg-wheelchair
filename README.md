All parts can be printed on a standard desktop 3d printer and hardware can be purchased from any common hardware store. 


The design goals for this project are:
* Open-Source design  
* Simple design + assembly  
* Low-Cost
* Comfortable for most small to medium sized dogs
* Mobility improvements for dogs with rear-leg issues
* Easy to acquire Bill of Materials
* Printable models (for inexpensive, desktop 3d printers)

Current issues:
* The design is untested as of 10/6/2015. Testing / assembly is scheduled within a month of this date.
* Need to acquire materials for harness design
* Requires the availability of 3d printing flexible material, which is not always available or compatible with all printers.
* Currently requires glue for assembly
